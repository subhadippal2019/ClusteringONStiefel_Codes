There is a criticism that the harmonic mean procedure does not work well if at least one of th MCMC sample comes from th low probability region. (example value:exp(-100))  i.e. bad sample.
In that case the Harmonic mean is unstable. Fortunately for the analysis we have conducted on vcg dataset, the above mentionned type of difficulty doesnot arise. The figures are plots of 
log likelihood for different MCMC sample.  Observe from plot that the probabilities are well away from zero. P(Data| parameterSample1) , ..., P(Data| parameterSample_McLen).
